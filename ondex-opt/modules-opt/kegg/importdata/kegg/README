Download instructions:
======================
1.   Go to ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/release/current/
1.1. Download the files kgml.tar.gz, ligand.tar.gz, genes.tar.gz, brite.tar.gz, medicus.tar.gz and pathways.tar.gz into this directory.
1.2. The new KEGG parser will convert all .tar.gz files into smaller .zip files during the first start.
1.3. During subsequent starts the KEGG parser will only need the .zip files.

Hint: Always make sure you have enough disk space for the conversion process and allow for enough time. The conversion process might take very long.
