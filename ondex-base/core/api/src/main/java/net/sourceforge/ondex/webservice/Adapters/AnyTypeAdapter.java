/*
 * Adapter to allow an interface to to used as a parameter or return in a webservice.
 *
 * Same as: com.sun.xml.bind.AnyTypeAdapter
 *
 * Does nothing more than pass the Object through.
 *
 * Note: The use of type specific adapter was not possible
 * due to the split between projects.
 * The Interface needs a reference to the adapter,
 * which would need a reference to the implementing class.
 * This would only be possible if all three interface, implementor and apadter
 * where placed in the same Maven project.
