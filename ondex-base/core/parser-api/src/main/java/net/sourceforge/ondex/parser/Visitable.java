/**
 * The main components in the ONDEX parser architecture are of type visitable. A Visitable interface is able to 
 * tell if an element (es, a data item or an ONDEX element) was already processed during the parsing process.
 * 
 * This might be useful or necessary in components like {@link ExploringMapper}, to avoid to fall in infinite loops, 
 * or to avoid to repeat entire exploring paths needlessly. When there is such a necessity, a component implementing this
 * interface (or its invoker) should set an element to visited by means of the {@link #setVisited(Object, boolean)}
 * method (or its {@link #setVisited(Object) shortcut}).
 * 
 * The interface has default implementations that makes an item always not visited.
