/**
 * <p>The exploring mapper. This is based on the idea to start from a set of data items, which are provided by 
 * a {@link #getRootsScanner() roots scanner}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Those items are then explored by means of a set of {@link #getLinkers() linkers}. Each linker contains a 
 * {@link Scanner} and a {@link RelationMapper}, the former is used to expand a root node into other nodes, the relation
 * mapper is used to create links from the initial root to each of the related nodes. A relation mapper can be a 
 * {@link ConceptBasedRelMapper concept-based relation mapper}, in which case the root and the related nodes are first 
 * mapped to {@link ONDEXConcept} by means of the explorer's {@link #getConceptMapper() explorer's concept mapper} and 
 * its {@link #getConceptClassMapper()} (both of which receives the discovered nodes as data source items to map. 
 * The nodes found to be related to the roots are then further explored by taking them as new roots and the process is 
 * recursively repeated in a top-down fashion, until the linkers return empty results.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>This kind of mapper is more generic than a mapper that explores a tree structure (such as an ontology), which is the 
 * typical case where this kind of mapper is expected to be used.</p>
 *
 * <p>Further options and details are available, see the method's comments below.</p>
 * 
 * @see InvertingRelationMapper which can be useful when you follow relations like subclassOf and you want to map
 * them as is-a.
